# WorkoutGenerator

## Description

This is an application that will help you create workouts.

I wanted to make an app for those times that I didn't have any inspiration for my workout, which happens from time to time.
I wanted to:
1. Be able to get a completely random workout if I wanted to.
2. Be able to choose which specific muscle groups to train and get a workout for those muscle groups (not finished yet).
3. Be able to keep track of your previous workouts so that the next one is different and your muscles have the time to recover (not finished yet).

All the features are not finished yet, but I will continue to work on them. This project was a lot more complicated than I thought it would be.
So I have just focused on getting the basic functionality to work first. As in:
- Be able to create a user.
- Be able to log in.
- Be able to (as an admin) get all users from the kafka topic.

The project is divided into to modules. One works as a Web-API and the other is the client-app.


B칬rja att g칬ra appen f칬r en admin-inloggning som kan g칬ra mycket mer 칛n en vanlig anv칛ndare.

### Admin ska kunna:
- Allt en vanlig anv칛ndare kan g칬ra, plus:


- Skapa/skicka exercices till topics --> databas.
    - Skapa en metod som skickar en exercice till EcerciseTopic --> databasen. (M친ste inneh친lla fk musclegroup).
- H칛mta **alla anv칛ndare** fr친n UserTopic via en consumer. (Uppfyller kravet p친 att kunna h칛mta data fr친n en topic via en consumer i klientappen)
    - Skapa en consumer som h칛mtar alla anv칛ndare fr친n UserTopic och skriver ut dem i terminalen.
- Skapa ny muskelgrupp.
    - Skapa en metod som skapar en ny muskelgrupp i MuscleGroupTopic --> databasen.


### Vanlig anv칛ndare ska kunna:
- Skapa ett konto. (Uppfyller kravet p친 att skicka data i JSON-format fr친n klienten via ett Web-API till en producer som sparar data i en kafka-topic)
    - Skapa en metod som skapar en user i UserTopic och en consumer som i sin tur sparar user i databasen.
- H칛mta en random exercice fr친n databasen.
    - Skapa en metod som h칛mtar en random exercice fr친n databasen.
- H칛mta en specifik exercice fr친n databasen baserat p친 vilken muskelgrupp den tillh칬r.
    - Skapa en metod som h칛mtar en specifik exercice fr친n databasen baserat p친 vilken muskelgrupp den tillh칬r.



## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
Before you can start this project, you must follow these steps:

- Install Apache Kafka on your local machine.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

- Open the project in your IDE.
- Start the Zookeeper and Kafka server.
- Start the Web-API.
- Start the client-app.
- Follow the instructions in the terminal to use the app.


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
* [member 1](https://github.com/person1)
